To start a container that isn't running and connect as root:

docker run -ti -u root --entrypoint=/bin/bash image_id_or_name -s

# Hiccups when updating the build environment

- When Pandoc changes, the LaTeX template changes. So sometime it's necessary to back-port src/templates/default.latex (check out the git history of that file to see how it has evolved). To create the *latest* template: 
`pandoc -D latex`.
- The LaTeX environment is too big, because of the way packages are installed in Ubuntu (a kind of all-or-nothing approach). I didn't have enough time to get `tlmgr` to work properly in the Ubuntu docker image, so I installed the big things. But `tlmgr` is more "surgical" and would result in a much smaller docker image. I'm missing a step to get it to work...
