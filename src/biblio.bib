  abstract =  {Software project tracking and project plan adjustment are two important software engineering activities. The class growth shows the design evolution of the software. The System Design Instability (SDI) metric indicates the progress of an object-oriented (OO) project once the project is set in motion. The \{SDI\} metric provides information on project evolution to project managers for possible adjustment to the project plan. The objectives of this paper are to test if the System Design Instability metric can be used to estimate and re-plan software projects in an XP-like agile process and study system design evolution in the Agile software process. We present an empirical study of the class growth and the \{SDI\} metric in two \{OO\} systems, developed using an agile process similar to Extreme Programming (XP). We analyzed the system evolutionary data collected on a daily basis from the two systems. We concluded that: the systems' class growth follows observable trends, the \{SDI\} metric can indicate project progress with certain trends, and the \{SDI\} metric is correlated with \{XP\} activities. In both of the analyzed systems, we observed two consistent jumps in the \{SDI\} metric values in early and late development phases. Part of the results agrees with a previous empirical study in another environment. },

  abstract =  {Several object-oriented cohesion metrics have been proposed in the literature. These metrics aim to measure the relationship between class members, namely, methods and attributes. Different metrics use different models to represent the connectivity pattern of cohesive interactions (CPCI) between class members. Most of these metrics are normalized to allow for easy comparison of the cohesion of different classes. However, in some cases, these metrics obtain the same cohesion values for different classes that have the same number of methods and attributes but different CPCIs. This leads to incorrectly considering the classes to be the same in terms of cohesion, even though their CPCIs clearly indicate that the degrees of cohesion are different. We refer to this as a lack of discrimination anomaly (LDA) problem. In this paper, we list and discuss cases in which the LDA problem exists, as expressed through the use of 16 cohesion metrics. In addition, we empirically study the frequent occurrence of the LDA problem when the considered metrics are applied to classes in five open source Java systems. Finally, we propose a metric and a simulation-based methodology to measure the discriminative power of cohesion metrics. The discrimination metric measures the probability that a cohesion metric will produce distinct cohesion values for classes with the same number of attributes and methods but different CPCIs. A highly discriminating cohesion metric is more desirable because it exhibits a lower chance of incorrectly considering classes to be cohesively equal when they have different CPCIs.},

  abstract  = {Cet ouvrage est une introduction pratique à l'analyse et la conception orientées objet (A/COO) au moyen du langage de modélisation UML et des design patterns. Il propose de suivre la démarche du Processus Unifié (UP), qui guide pas à pas l'utilisateur, de la spécification des besoins au code de l'application. Le Processus Unifié utilise UML qui s'est imposé comme le standard international de notation graphique pour la modélisation objet. Le livre y a donc recours, à l'aide de nombreux exemples de diagrammes expliqués en détail pour enseigner l'A/COO. L'ouvrage présente également les patterns de conception (design patterns) qui constituent les ""meilleures pratiques"" que les experts en A/COO appliquent au développement de systèmes. Il apprend à employer ces patterns, notamment les célèbres patterns GoF et les patterns GRASP. La pédagogie de l'ouvrage se caractérise par l'analyse complète de deux études de cas, qui illustrent de façon réaliste tout le processus d'A/COO. Reconnu comme l'un des plus grands experts mondiaux en UML et génie logiciel, Craig Larman est actuellement directeur scientifique chez Valtech (entreprise de conseil internationale). II est l'auteur de plusieurs ouvrages sur la conception objet et UML dont Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide; Java 2 Performance and Idiom Guide Applying UML and Design Patterns. Il est également consultant et conférencier international.

  Abstract                 = {This book isn't an introduction to object-oriented technology or design. Many books already do a good job of that. This book assumes you are reasonably proficient in at least one object-oriented programming language, and you should have some experience in object-oriented design as well. You definitely shouldn't have to rush to the nearest dictionary the moment we mention "types" and"polymorphism," or "interface" as opposed to "implementation" inheritance.On the other hand, this isn't an advanced technical treatise either. It's a book of design patterns that describes simple and elegant solutions to specific problems in object-oriented software design. Design patterns capture solutions that have developed and evolved over time. Hence they aren't the designs people They reflect untold redesign and recoding as developers have struggled for greater reuse and flexibility in their software.Design patterns capture these solutions in a succinct and easily applied form.The design patterns require neither unusual language features nor amazing programming tricks with which to astound your friends and managers. All can be implemented in standard object-oriented languages, though they might take a little more work than ad hoc solutions. But the extra effort invariably pays dividends in increased flexibility and reusability.Once you understand the design patterns and have had an "Aha!" and not just a "Huh?" experience with them, you won't ever think about object-oriented design in the same way. You'll have insights that can make your own designs more flexible, modular, reusable, and understandable - which is why you're interested in object-oriented technology in the first place, right?A word of warning and encouragement: Don't worry if you don't understand this book completely on the first reading. We didn't understand it all on the first writing! Remember that this isn't a book to read once and put on a shelf. We hope you'll find yourself referring to it again and again for design insights and for inspiration.This book has had a long gestation. It has seen four countries, three of its authors' marriages, and the birth of two unrelated offspring.Many people have had a part in its development. Special thanks are due Bruce Andersen, Kent Beck, and Andre Weinand for their inspiration and advice. We also thank those who reviewed drafts of the manuscript: Roger Bielefeld, Grady Booch, Tom Cargill, Marshall Cline, Ralph Hyre, Brian Kernighan, Thomas Laliberty, Mark Lorenz, Arthur Riel, Doug Schmidt, Clovis Tondo, Steve Vinoski, and Rebecca Wirfs-Brock. We are also grateful to the team at Addison-Wesley for their help and patience: Kate Habib, Tiffany Moore, Lisa Raffaele, Pradeepa Siva, and John Wait. Special thanks to Carl Kessler, Danny Sabbah, and Mark Wegman at IBM Research for their unflagging support of this work.Last but certainly not least, we thank everyone on the Internet and points beyond who commented on versions of the patterns, offered encouraging words, and told us that what we were doing was worthwhile.

  abstract = {We use 810 versions of the Linux kernel, released over a period of 14 years, to characterize the system's evolution, using Lehman's laws of software evolution as a basis. We investigate different possible interpretations of these laws, as reflected by different metrics that can be used to quantify them. For example, system growth has traditionally been quantified using lines of code or number of functions, but functional growth of an operating system like Linux can also be quantified using the number of system calls. In addition we use the availability of the source code to track metrics, such as McCabe's cyclomatic complexity, that have not been tracked across so many versions previously. We find that the data supports several of Lehman's laws, mainly those concerned with growth and with the stability of the process. We also make some novel observations, e.g. that the average complexity of functions is decreasing with time, but this is mainly due to the addition of many small functions. },

  abstract =     {Object-oriented (OO) approaches of software development promised better maintainable and reusable systems, but the complexity resulting from its features usually introduce some faults that are difficult to detect or anticipate during software change process. Thus, the earlier they are detected, found and fixed, the lesser the maintenance costs. Several OO metrics have been proposed for assessing the quality of OO design and code and several empirical studies have been undertaken to validate the impact of OO metrics on fault proneness (FP). The question now is which metrics are useful in measuring the FP of OO classes? Consequently, we investigate the existing empirical validation of CK + SLOC metrics based on their state of significance, validation and usefulness. We used systematic literature review (SLR) methodology over a number of relevant article sources, and our results show the existence of 29 relevant empirical studies. Further analysis indicates that coupling, complexity and size measures have strong impact on FP of OO classes. Based on the results, we therefore conclude that these metrics can be used as good predictors for building quality fault models when that could assist in focusing resources on high risk components that are liable to cause system failures, when only CK + SLOC metrics are used.},

criterion of stability and a definition of distance to flag design characteristics that have potentially contributed to long-term

show that the method can provide insight into the relative importance of individual elements of a set of design characteristics for the

The law was developed during the design and implementation of the Demeter system, which provides a high-level interface to class-based, object-oriented systems. Two forms of the law, the class and object forms, are described. Its motivation is to ensure that the software is as modular as possible. Principles covered by the law include coupling control, information hiding, information restriction, information localization, and structured induction. An example is given to show how the law is applied, and valid violations are identified. It is shown how to transform a method that does not satisfy the law into one that does.<>},

Both the original implementation and the inevitable subsequent evolution (maintenance) are a continual learning experience driven, inter alia, by feedback from the results of the behaviour under execution of the software, as perceived by various stakeholders, by advances and growth in the user organisations and by adaptation to changes in the external world, both independent and as a result of installation and use of the software. Real world, termed type-E, software is essentially evolutionary in nature. The study of the processes of evolution of such software is of considerable interest, as is that of the domains that co-evolve with the software. After briefly discussing the meaning of the term evolution in the context of software, its technology, the software process and related domains, this paper describes some of the facets of the evolution phenomenon and implications to the evolution process as identified during many years of active interest in the topic.},

The control graphs of several actual Fortran programs are then presented to illustrate the correlation between intuitive complexity and the graph-theoretic complexity. Several properties of the graph-theoretic complexity are then proved which show, for example, that complexity is independent of physical size (adding or subtracting functional statements leaves complexity unchanged) and complexity depends only on the decision structure of a program.},

Currently proposed measures for cohesion in Object-Oriented (OO) software reflect particular interpretations of cohesion and capture different aspects of it. Existing approaches are largely based on using the structural information from the source code, such as attribute references, in methods to measure cohesion. This paper proposes a new measure for the cohesion of classes in OO software systems based on the analysis of the unstructured information embedded in the source code, such as comments and identifiers. The measure, named the Conceptual Cohesion of Classes (C3), is inspired by the mechanisms used to measure textual coherence in cognitive psychology and computational linguistics. This paper presents the principles and the technology that stand behind the C3 measure. A large case study on three open source software systems is presented which compares the new measure with an extensive set of existing metrics and uses them to construct models that predict software faults. The case study shows that the novel measure captures different aspects of class cohesion compared to any of the existing cohesion measures. In addition, combining C3 with existing structural cohesion metrics proves to be a better predictor of faulty classes when compared to different combinations of structural cohesion metrics.},

In this paper, design stability measures which indicate the potential ripple effect characteristics due to modifications of the program at the design level are presented. These measures can be generated at any point in the design phase of the software life cycle which enables early maintainability feedback to the software developers. The validation of these measures and future research efforts involving the development of a user-oriented maintainability measure, which incorporates the design stability measures as well as other design measures, are discussed.},

  abstract   = {You can use this book to design a house for yourself with your family; you can use it to work with your neighbors to improve your town and neighborhood; you can use it to design an office, or a workshop, or a public building. And you can use it to guide you in the actual process of construction. After a ten-year silence, Christopher Alexander and his colleagues at the Center for Environmental Structure are now publishing a major statement in the form of three books which will, in their words, "lay the basis for an entirely new approach to architecture, building and planning, which will we hope replace existing ideas and practices entirely." The three books are The Timeless Way of Building, The Oregon Experiment, and this book, A Pattern Language. At the core of these books is the idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets, and communities. This idea may be radical (it implies a radical transformation of the architectural profession) but it comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people. At the core of the books, too, is the point that in designing their environments people always rely on certain "languages," which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a forma system which gives them coherence. This book provides a language of this kind. It will enable a person to make a design for almost any kind of building, or any part of the built environment. "Patterns," the units of this language, are answers to design problems (How high should a window sill be? How many stories should a building have? How much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and trees?). More than 250 of the patterns in this pattern language are given: each consists of a problem statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seemly likely that they will be a part of human nature, and human action, as much in five hundred years as they are today.},

This is valuable information from two respected software engineers whose popular series of talks—including "Working with Poisonous People"—has attracted hundreds of thousands of followers.Writing software is a team sport, and human factors have as much influence on the outcome as technical factors. Even if you've spent decades learning the technical side of programming, this book teaches you about the often-overlooked human component. By learning to collaborate and investing in the "soft skills" of software engineering, you can have a much greater impact for the same amount of effort.Team Geek was named as a Finalist in the 2013 Jolt Awards from Dr. Dobb's Journal.
